# Skynet Workshop

This repo is a workshop aimed at onboarding developers onto Skynet.

The [/app](./app) directory can be used to build your application by following
the Steps in the [README](./app/README). Alternatively you can create a new
local project directory.

To get started building your Skapp (Skynet Application) in the [/app](./app)
directory, fork this repo and `cd` into [/app](./app).

To get started building your Skapp in a local project directory, create your
directory and `cd` into it. Additionally you will need to have `wget` install to
be able to download the template files.
